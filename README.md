# BJT Amplifier
This is a circuit design for a three-stage bipolar junction transistor (BJT) amplifier. The design chosen consists of two common-collector (CC) amplifiers with a common-emitter (CE) amplifier in between. The CE amplifier performed the amplification while the CC amplifiers mitigated the impacts of internal resistance.

Specifications for this design included a no-load voltage gain of 50% and a minimum voltage swing of 8 volts. A power supply of 10 volts was used with no more than 10 mA of quiescent current being drawn from it. Additionally, only certain resistor and capacitor values could be used in the circuit. The design for this circuit is shown below.
